The sphere has a vertical resolution of 16 leds, therefore the horizontal resolution should be 16 as well to make image processing simple.
32 pixel wide images would be better, but they would have to be custom made.
Another possibility is to have two seperate images on each side of the sphere
That means 180&deg;/16 = 11.25&deg; is the angular width of a pixel.

gears:
gear on base 16 tooth
gear on motor: 48 tooth
=> 1 rotation of motor = 3 rotations of sphere
